# The coupon collectorâ€™s problem. 
Each box of a certain breakfast cereal contains one of ten
different coupons, each with the same probability. We win a prize if we manage to obtain a
complete collection of all the different coupons. How long on average do we have to wait? For
example, suppose we draw the following coupons, in order:
5, 2, 3, 7, 5, 1, 1, 4, 8, 4, 1, 9, 10, 2, 3, 3, 6.

With the last coupon (6), we have completed our collection, and so we stop (after altogether 17
steps). What if we had more coupons? Can we deduce an asymptotic formula for a large number of
coupons? What about the case where some boxes do not have coupons, or one coupon is more/less
probable to choose?
